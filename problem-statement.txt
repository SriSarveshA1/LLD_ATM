Design an ATM:

1.Design an ATM machine that can handle various transactions like 
    withdrawals, 
    deposits, 
    balance inquiries,
    transfers.

2.Consider security aspects, user authentication

3.Different types of accounts (savings, checking, etc.).


---------------------------------------------

Requirments:
1. The ATM should be able to perform only a single transaction at a time. We should be throwing error
when some one is trying to make more than one transaction at a time.
2. User should be able to insert a valid card and can perform operations like 
    withdrawals 
    balance inquiries (Limiting the number of operations to simulate interview)
And if the entered card is not valid then we should be throwing respective error.
3. And before performing each of the operations we will be asking the users the card PIN and we let the user's 
type the PIN and if the PIN is valid we proceed to the next operation.
  And we should have proper PIN validation logic for the respective card and how many times the 
pin has been entered should be tracked in the server side.
4. And also the user will be able to cancel the transaction from different states of the whole
transaction and if the user is trying to cancel the transaction from a invalid state we should be 
throwing error.
5. And we need to have checks like before performing operations like before performing the withdraw operation
    we should be able to check the card has the enough balance 
    And the atm has the enough money that is requested.
    And the maximum amount we can withdraw in a day.
And while performing these checks if there are checks that are not followed we will be throwing proper error.
